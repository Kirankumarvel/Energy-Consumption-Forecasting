# 🔋 Energy Consumption Forecasting

Forecast household energy consumption using machine learning—specifically Random Forest Regression. This project focuses on applying regression metrics, visualizations, and model interpretation to deliver insightful energy usage predictions.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal is to predict energy consumption (`Appliances`) based on several environmental and internal parameters such as temperature, humidity, and lighting.

---

## 📂 Dataset

Use a dataset like the **UCI Energy Efficiency** dataset or any real-world home energy consumption dataset (e.g., hourly/daily data with appliance usage).

---

## 📊 Features Example

- Temperature in various rooms
- Humidity levels
- Visibility
- Wind speed
- Lighting
- Time-based features (hour, weekday)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🧪 Metrics Evaluated

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot
- Residual Distribution
- Feature Importances

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the forecasting script:
   ```bash
   python energy_forecasting.py
   ```

---

## 📌 Use Cases
